## What is Masterschool?

Masterschool is an online only coding school based in Israel. So far we learned Javascript, CSS, HTML, React, DOM manipulation, async-await functions, debugging, Git, routing and website layouts. Our teachers are industry-leading experts who are currently employed in senior development roles. Every student learns to adapt their studies to their respective timezones.

## What is the purpose of this project?

First and foremost to learn to operate effectively in a team, build collaboration skills and to put git conventions into practice. We were first instructed to create a group of three, which required good communication skills and depended on the social network already built within the school thanks to our own initiative. Once our team was formed we were instructed to build an app together which would tackle a social issue.

## What is this app?

An app called "Workers Rights" which is designed for workers in all sectors to get help if they are suffering from mistreatment at work. The app connects them with the lawyers and unions nearest to them and with the most relevant experience in solving their problem.

## How did we make our collaboration work?

Andy, who is the most competent coder, was our group leader. The three of us already knew each other from working on a Next.js project so we decided to work together on this one. We communicated via Slack and Trello, and had regular Zoom meetings. First we created a mock-up via <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/9xDhEqRp6fD1m4Gq8ErDuK/106-Team-Project-team-library?node-id=421%3A54&t=lFiqQliQfpxSA3VK-0">Figma</a>. Then we created different branches for different components and component versions. Andy managed the branch merging, Firebase authentication, routing, page layout and debugging. Vedran managed the forms, footer, database and the desktop CSS. I (Antonia) managed the navbar and worked with Vedran on the database and desktop CSS.
